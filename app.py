# OOP Principles

  # getter, setter, and deleter in python

  # @property = as decorator on top of a function to make it a getter function
  # return self.name

  # @name.setting = as decoratoron top of a function to make it a setter function
  # self.name = name 

  #@name.deleter 
  # del self.name

  # don't have to invoke setter, getter, and deleter like a normal function
  # print(customers[0].name)

  # del.customers[0].name


# Encapsulation - wrapping up data and functions together 
# Keeps data safe. Prevents access to methods/variables outside of a class 
# Creating a class is a form of encapsulation

# single underscore _ = private, but still can be used
# double underscore = __ = private, and can't be used 
# don't ever call these functions 


# Abstraction - handles complexity by hiding unnecessary information from user. This lets you implement even more complex logic
# on top of the abstracted information without having to understand the previous information.

# Creating an abstract class. This class can have abstract methods or non-abstract methods inside of it
